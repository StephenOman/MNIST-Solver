# MNIST-Solver
Using Python to create a neural network to solve the MNIST dataset


This notebook contains a fully worked through example of building an Artificial Neural Network to solve MNIST. It uses Numpy for the matrix multiplication, but other than that, does not rely on any frameworks for the network.
